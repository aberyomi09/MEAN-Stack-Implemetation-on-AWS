# What is the MEAN stack?
The MEAN stack (mean.js) is an open-source JavaScript (JS) framework used for developing robust web applications. It is a set of software tools that include everything needed for building dynamic websites and web applications.

As it uses a single programming language, JavaScript, in each layer of the stack, it has a big role in simplifying development.

MEAN is an acronym of the following programs:

MongoDB (document database)

Express (back-end application framework)

Angular (front-end application framework)

Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment)

This framework comes as an alternative to the widely known LAMP stack, which uses JS on the client side, but PHP on the server side.
